**Where 2 CS students cooked**

## About

This project, titled **RFALM PROJECT**, is an initiative by two computer science students (AKBOUDJ ANIS MOHAMMED NASSIM & CHOUDDER MOHAMED NACER ELLAH). It is an ALSDD project.

## Features

- **C Language Implementation**: The project is developed using the C programming language.
- **Modular Structure**: The codebase is organized into multiple modules, each handling specific functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Entry point of the application.
- `nav.c` / `nav.h`: Navigation-related functionalities.
- `production.c` / `production.h`: Production module.
- `queue.c` / `queue.h`: Queue data structure implementation.
- `robot.c` / `robot.h`: Robot-related operations.
- `task.c` / `task.h`: Task management.
- `tree.c` / `tree.h`: Tree data structure implementation.
- `gtk4-version(not the complete C code).rar`: Contains a GTK4 version of the project (incomplete).
- `program.exe`: Compiled executable of the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/credit23/RFALM-PROJECT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd RFALM-PROJECT
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**:
   Use a C compiler like `gcc` to compile the source files. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c nav.c production.c queue.c robot.c task.c tree.c -o program
   ```

4. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./program
   ```

## Usage

After compiling and running the program, follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
